//! `make bench`: one run, three independent reports and a package.
//!
//! [`load_report`] is the cost of getting a map on screen; [`frame_report`] is
//! the cost of a frame once it is there; [`counter_report`] is what the frame
//! asked the machine to do to cost that. They share a process and nothing else
//! — any of them can be MISS while the others stand — and the split between the
//! first two is the first playable frame, where the recorder switches phase.
//!
//! All three are printed to stdout at exit and written to
//! `iw4l-artifacts/bench/<stamp>.txt`, so a run can be diffed against the one
//! before it. The same text, the [`manifest`] that says what the run *was* and
//! the [`summary`] of the same numbers as data go to the run's own directory,
//! next to the trace it recorded. Off unless `IW4L_BENCH` is set.
