//! Section one: where the time between the command and a playable map went.
//!
//! Two views of the same window, because one alone lies. The **waterfall** is
//! the serial story — request, walk, install, spawn, first drawn frame — and it
//! is what a player waits through. The **stages** are the parallel story: the
//! walk runs on the load pool, so a stage's own duration says nothing about
//! whether removing it would shorten anything.
//!
//! `sole_open` is the time a stage was the only one open. It used to be
//! printed as an upper bound on what deleting the stage could save, and it is
//! not one: a stage that was never alone can still be exactly what everything
//! behind it is queued on, and deleting it would then save its whole length.
//! The number says how much of the window this stage was the only thing the
//! load was doing. What deleting it would save is a question for
//! `load_jobs.csv` and its dependency edges.
