//! One run, one directory.
//!
//! The trace, its manifest and the bench report are three views of a single
//! execution, and a reader comparing two runs should not have to pair them up
//! by timestamp. So the id is minted here rather than by whichever recorder
//! happens to start first, and a run has the same name whether `IW4L_PERF`,
//! `IW4L_BENCH` or both are set.
//!
//! Nothing is created until something asks. A process that records neither
//! leaves no directory behind.
