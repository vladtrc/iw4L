//! Work that must finish before the process leaves (a trace flush, a bench
//! report, screenshot writes), and the exit that runs it.
//!
//! `std::process::exit` runs the C library's exit handlers, the GPU driver's
//! teardown among them, while render and pipeline-compile threads may still
//! be inside the driver: the process then dies on a segfault, and the sound
//! server keeps looping the audio it last had while the core is written.
//! [`exit_now`] runs the hooks registered here and leaves without that
//! teardown. A hook still runs, once, on any other exit that does run the
//! C library's handlers.
